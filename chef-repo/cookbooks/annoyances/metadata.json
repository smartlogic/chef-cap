  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nRemoves a number of operating system based annoyances. There are\nrecipes RHEL and Debian platform families.\n\nFeel free to fork and submit your own patches.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n## Platform\n\nSupports both `rhel` and `debian` platform families.\n\n* Debian, Ubuntu\n* Red Hat, CentOS, Scientific, Oracle, Amazon, Fedora\n\nIf your Chef/Ohai version aren't new enough for the\n`node['platform_family']` attribute, then simply include the\nplatform-specific recipe.\n\nRecipes\n=======\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nLooks at the node's `platform_family` and includes the proper recipe,\nthen removes `annoyances` from the node's run list on completion.\n\nIf the node's `platform_family` is not found, an exception will be\nraised.\n\n## rhel\n\nRemoves any preexisting firewall rules, turns off SELinux, uninstalls\nhttpd if it's on for some reason and removes /root/.bash_logout if it\nexists.\n\nIf the `apache2` recipe is on the node, the httpd package will not be\nremoved.\n\n## debian\n\nDoes an \"apt-get update\", turns off apparmor and turns off byobu.\nRemoves whoopsie, popularity-contest, and unity-lens-shopping if this\never got on a server.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude the `annoyances` recipe in your run list and it will make the\nvarious changes, then remove itself from the node's run list on\ncompletion. If you want to keep enforcing the `annoyances` with each\nrun, directly include the operating system-specific recipe instead of\nthe `default` recipe.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Matt Ray (<matt@opscode.com>)\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright 2012 Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
