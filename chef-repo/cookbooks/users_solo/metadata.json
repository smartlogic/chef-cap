The default data bag in this recipe is \"users\".  See USAGE.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis cookbook is specific for setting up sysadmin group and users for now.\n\n    include_recipe \"users_solo::admins\"\n\nUse knife to create a data bag for users.\n\n    knife data bag create users\n\nCreate a user.\n\n    knife data bag users bofh\n\t{\n\t  \"id\": \"rgaiser\",\n\t  \"ssh_keys\": [\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA...\"],\n\t  \"groups\": [\"admin\"],\n\t  \"uid\": 2001,\n\t  \"shell\": \"\\/bin\\/bash\",\n\t  \"comment\": \"Roberto Gaiser\" \n\t}\n\nRemove a user, rgaiser.\n\n    knife data bag users bofh\n\t{\n\t  \"id\": \"rgaiser\",\n\t  \"ssh_keys\": [\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA...\"],\n\t  \"groups\": [\"admin\"],\n\t  \"uid\": 2001,\n\t  \"shell\": \"\\/bin\\/bash\",\n\t  \"comment\": \"Roberto Gaiser\",\n\t  \"action\": \"remove\"\n\t}\n\n    * Note only user bags with the \"action : remove\" and a search-able \"group\" attribute will be purged by the :remove action.\n\nThe default recipe makes use of the \"users_manage\" Lightweight Resource Provider (LWRP), and looks like this:\n\n\n```\n  users_manage \"admin\" do\n    group_id 2600\n    action [ :remove, :create ]\n  end\n```\n\nNote this LWRP searches the \"users\" data bag for the \"admin\" group attribute, and adds those users to a Unix security group \"admin\".  The only required attribute is group_id, which represents the numeric Unix gid and *must* be unique.  The default action for the LWRP is \":create\" only.\n\nIf you have different requirements, for example:\n\n * You want to search a different data bag specific to a role such as mail.  You may change the data_bag searched.\n   - data_bag \"mail\"\n * You want to search for a different group attribute named \"postmaster\".  You may change the search_group attribute.  This attribute defaults to the LWRP resource name.\n   - search_group \"postmaster\"\n * You want to add the users to a security group other than the lightweight resource name.  You may change the group_name attribute.  This attribute also defaults to the LWRP resource name.\n   - group_name \"wheel\"\n * Users can have a pre configured numeric GID set on the data bag, otherwise a group with the user login will be created.\n\nPutting these requirements together our recipe might look like this:\n\n```\n  users_manage \"postmaster\" do\n    data_bag \"mail\"\n    group_name \"wheel\"\n    group_id 10\n  end\n```\n\nThe latest version of knife supports reading data bags from a file and automatically looks in a directory called +data_bags+ in the current directory. The \"bag\" should be a directory with JSON files of each item. For the above:\n\n    mkdir data_bags/users\n    $EDITOR data_bags/users/bofh.json\n\nPaste the user's public SSH key into the ssh_keys value. Also make sure the uid is unique, and if you're not using bash, that the shell is installed. The default search, and Unix group is sysadmin.\n\nThe recipe, by default, will also create the admin group.\n\nThe admin group will be created with GID 2600. This may become an attribute at a later date.\n\nThe Apache cookbook can set up authentication using OpenIDs, which is set up using the openid key here.
